This is the repository for house price prediction
Let me breif you about it

## Inspiration
This is inspired from the kaggle competition of [House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
Here after basic pre-processing I am able to get placed at a rank of 1254/4552.
I would not say the project is in development phase and I got an idea of linking it with three js.
Sounds funny right ðŸ¤¯.

## Usage
Install the dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

The site has been hosted using the flask framework

To view the prototype

```cd WebSide/Client/House Price/
npm run dev
```

However the site is still under development for the linking part and there are still somechanges to be made in paths
